- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MZASU
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer, games and climbing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 

     - computer graphics engine (Vulkan),
    
     - neural network (implemented a FNN trained with MNIST in c++ with eigen only),
    
     - OS/compiler (very beggining of bootloader&kernel so far)
    

- ðŸ§¾ My goals are:

    - Basic 3D engine to write small games (nothing better than Everquest) and cool visuals 

    - Learn DRL/A2C to make an AI play a small 2D game i wrote 

    - Basic cli/file system + own language -> if motivated rewrite os with said language 

    - Learn enough AndroidDev to write small apps that come to my mind ( good metronome, texas hold'em money balance with blinds/dealer etc) 

    - Have basic knowledge of security 
                   
- ðŸ“… I hope I will be able to finish all of them.
